# EightBitCalc

An 8-bit binary calculator made with the C# programming language.

Available operations and flags mimic the 6502 processor.

Made with the intention of being a learning tool for understanding bitwise operations and 6502 assembly language.

Big thanks to [Gustavo Pezzi](https://pikuma.com/) for teaching me about bit-shifting, the 6502 processor and 6502 assembly language with the video [Understanding Bit-Shifting Operators](https://youtu.be/-0FLvN7w3ZI) and the absolutely fantastic course [NES Programming with 6502 Assembly](https://pikuma.com/courses/nes-game-programming-tutorial)
